### How can I test these programs? 🖥
In CS50, we use their own IDE, and they have a private header, cs50.h, that provide some functions to the students. So, a lot of these programs above only will work in that environment. But it's easy to use. Just access de [IDE url](https://ide.cs50.io/) and connect to github, then upload the `programFile.c`, execute the command `make programFile` on the console and test it! If the program doesn't have the cs50 header, you can test it on [repl](https://repl.it/languages/c).
