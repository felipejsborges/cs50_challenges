### What is? 🤔
A [program](./substitution.c) that runs a plurality election. The candidates names must be inserted as a command-line argument. The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election. It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, the program output the names of each of the winning candidates.
